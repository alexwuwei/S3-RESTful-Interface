# S3-RESTful-Interface
A large part of back-end programming is interfacing with external APIs. This project is an opportunity to learn backend programming beyond the usual CRUD database operations.  Specifically, your app will have a collection of users, and each user will have a collection of files. However, your api will not accept actual files, nor will it return actual files (HTTP with binary data, while possible, is a little messy for the purposes of this assignment). Instead, when creating a new file you will post a json representation of a file, such as:  superagent /users/:user/files post ' {"fileName": "fileOne": "content": "hello world!"}  On your backend you will then create a file named fileOne, with the contents "hello world!". This is a lot like the http with persistance assignment.  Next, instead of saving this file to your mongo database, you will save it to your s3 account. You will then store in your mongo database the url to retrieve this file from s3.  When serving a get request for the file. i.e. GET /users/:user/files/:file return a json object that contains the url the the file location on S3.
